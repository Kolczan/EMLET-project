Cryptocurrencies have gained significant attention in recent years, with their prices being highly volatile and influenced by various factors. The goal is to develop a ML model that can effectively forecast cryptocurrency prices based on historical data.\n\nIn this report, I will outline the problem statement, describe the dataset chosen for this project, and present preliminary analysis conducted on the dataset.s",

Given the historical data of various cryptocurrencies, we aim to develop a model that can accurately predict their prices over a specified time horizon.\n\nKey components of the problem statement include:\n- Data Collection: Gathering historical cryptocurrency price data.\n- Feature Engineering: Selecting relevant features that could influence cryptocurrency prices.\n- Model Selection: Choosing appropriate machine learning algorithms for prediction.\n- Evaluation Metrics: Determining metrics to evaluate the performance of the predictive model.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to create a model that traders and investors can use to make informed decisions in the cryptocurrency market.\n",
